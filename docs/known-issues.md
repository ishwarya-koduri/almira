# Known issues

A running log of things found while building, that are **not** being fixed in
the change that found them — either because the code is frozen, because the fix
belongs to a feature we have not opened yet, or because the right moment to
reconcile it is the next time someone is already in that file.

The rule for this file: an entry is written the moment it is noticed, with
enough detail that whoever picks it up does not have to rediscover it. An entry
is deleted when it is fixed, and the commit that fixes it says so.

Status: **open** unless a later line says otherwise.

## 1. Field order differs between the app and the web client

**Where** `app/shared/.../capture/FormModel.kt` (`toFormFields`) and
`backend/src/main/resources/static/app/screens/capture.js` (`captureForm`).

**What** Both clients generate the capture form from the type's `field_schema`,
so they always agree on *which* fields exist, what they are called, which are
required and what they accept. They order them differently:

- **App** — merges the re-labelled columns and the type's attributes into one
  list and sorts the whole thing by `sort`.
- **Web** — renders every re-labelled column first, then every attribute, so
  `sort` only orders within each of those two groups.

**Which is right** The app. The numbers in the schema plainly intend an
interleave: a Fixed Deposit's `interest_rate` is sort 30, between `Principal`
at 20 and `Opened on` at 40, and Principal → rate → dates is the order someone
reads off an FD receipt. The web pushes the rate below both dates.

**Why it is still here** The fix is a change to frozen-adjacent web code, and
it is worth making deliberately rather than as a side effect of an app stage.
This is an intended, known divergence until then.

**When to fix** The next time we open `capture.js` for its own reasons. Sort the
merged list the way `toFormFields` does; there is no API change and no data
change.

**Risk if left** Cosmetic only. Nothing that reaches the server can differ.

## 2. `POST /api/v1/auth/otp/verify` returns 500 for a missing `phone`

**Where** `backend/.../auth/AuthController.kt` (`OtpVerifyBody`).

**What** Omitting the `phone` field returns

```
500  {"error":{"code":"internal_error","message":"Something went wrong on our side…"}}
```

The cause is `HttpMessageNotReadableException` wrapping Jackson's
`MissingKotlinParameterException` for a non-nullable Kotlin constructor
parameter. It escapes the validation handler and lands in the generic 500 path.

**What it should be** A 400 naming the field, like every other bad request the
API answers.

**Why it is still here** v1 is frozen, and no client hits this: both the web
client and the app always send `phone`. Found by a hand-written curl probe.

**When to fix** The next backend pass. Adding an
`@ExceptionHandler(HttpMessageNotReadableException::class)` that maps a missing
or unreadable body to a 400 would cover this and every sibling body type at
once. It is additive — a status changing from 500 to 400 on a malformed request
is not a v1 contract break.

**Risk if left** Low. It misreports a client error as a server error, which
costs someone debugging time and makes a genuine outage harder to spot in logs.

## 3. A static-asset change needs a service-worker version bump

**Where** `backend/src/main/resources/static/sw.js` (`VERSION`).

**What** The shell is cached cache-first, deliberately (docs/17), so an edit to
`base.css`, `app.js` or any other shell asset is invisible to a browser that
has already installed the worker until `VERSION` changes. During development
this reads as "my change did nothing" — it cost a build and a wrong diagnosis
while building the phone navigation.

**Why it is still here** It is the cache strategy working as designed, not a
defect. Writing it down is cheaper than rediscovering it.

**When to fix** Not a fix — a habit. Bump `VERSION` in the same commit as any
shell asset change. If this keeps biting, the durable answer is to derive the
version from a build property rather than a hand-edited constant.

**Risk if left** Development friction only. Released builds are fine, because a
release always changes the version.

---

## 4. Screenshot and recents protection is off in debug builds

**Where** `app/androidApp/.../MainActivity.kt`.

**What** `FLAG_SECURE` keeps a family's net worth out of the recents thumbnail
and out of screenshots. It is applied only when `!BuildConfig.DEBUG`, because
it also blacks out `adb exec-out screencap`, and a stage whose evidence is a
black rectangle cannot be reviewed.

**Why it is still here** Deliberate, and the release path is correct. What is
*unverified* is the release path: every screenshot in the review of this stage
is from a debug build, so the flag has been reasoned about rather than seen
working.

**When to fix** Not a fix — a verification. Build once with
`assembleRelease`, confirm `screencap` returns black and the recents card shows
a blank app, then record that here and delete this entry.

**Risk if left** None in production. The risk is only that we believe something
we have not watched happen.

## 5. iOS one-time-code autofill cannot be reached from Compose 1.8.2

**Where** `app/shared/src/commonMain/.../signin/OtpKeyboard.kt` and its two
actuals.

**What** iOS autofill is declarative: a field with
`textContentType = .oneTimeCode` makes the keyboard offer the code from the most
recent message, and no runtime API is called — which is why the iOS
`OtpAutofill` actual is an honest no-op rather than a stub that throws.

The attribute itself cannot be set. Compose Multiplatform 1.8.2's iOS text input
builds its traits in `androidx.compose.ui.platform.getUITextInputTraits`, whose
only input is `ImeOptions`, and `ImeOptions` carries no content type. Read off
the shipped klib rather than inferred:

- the entire iOS Compose UI klib contains exactly three content-type constants —
  `UITextContentTypePassword`, `UITextContentTypeEmailAddress` and
  `UITextContentTypeTelephoneNumber`. There is no `OneTimeCode` anywhere in it.
- `androidx.compose.ui.autofill.ContentType` *does* declare `SmsOtpCode`, but
  the string appears in no file under `package_androidx.compose.ui.platform` —
  the iOS text-input service never reads that semantics property.

**What this found on the way** `KeyboardType.NumberPassword` maps to
`UITextContentTypePassword`, so the six-cell code field was telling iOS it was a
password field and iOS would have offered saved passwords and Strong Password
over a one-time code. That is worse than offering nothing, and it is fixed:
`otpKeyboardType` is now `expect`/`actual`, staying `NumberPassword` on Android
(where it also keeps the code out of the keyboard's suggestions and dictionary)
and becoming a plain `Number` on iOS, which claims no content type at all.

**When to fix** Either a Compose version that maps `ContentType.SmsOtpCode`
through to `textContentType`, or a `UIKitView`-hosted `UITextField` on iOS only.
The second is available today and is deliberately not taken: it would replace
the six-cell field on one platform, and a visible design divergence is a poor
trade for one convenience.

**Risk if left** iOS users type six digits by hand. No incorrect behaviour and
no data risk now that the password claim is gone.

## 6. AES-GCM on iOS comes from Swift, not from the shared module

**Where** `app/shared/src/iosMain/.../zk/Aead.ios.kt` and
`app/iosApp/iosApp/CryptoKitAead.swift`.

**What** Not a defect — a constraint worth recording, because it qualifies a
claim earlier stages leaned on. Every other iOS-specific primitive in this app
is C and is called from Kotlin directly: the Keychain and the random from
Security, PBKDF2 and HMAC over CommonCrypto, the prompt from
LocalAuthentication. AES-256-GCM is the exception:

- CryptoKit is Swift-only and unreachable from Kotlin/Native.
- the public CommonCrypto headers in the iOS SDK expose no GCM at all — not
  `CCCryptorGCM*`, not `kCCModeGCM`. Those live in `CommonCryptorSPI.h`, which
  the SDK does not ship.

So `AppleAead` is injected from Swift by `installAppleAead` before any Compose
content exists. The seam holds — nothing above `Aead.kt` knows — but "iOS is a
target-add, not a rewrite" is true with the qualification that the add includes
about forty lines of Swift, and this is the whole reason any Swift beyond the
app shell exists.

Rolling GCM over CommonCrypto's AES-CTR by hand was considered and rejected: the
authenticating half is GHASH, and a hand-written GHASH inside a product whose
entire claim is that the server cannot read the data is not a trade worth
making.

**Consequence to keep in mind** A future iOS entry point that forgets
`installAppleAead` fails loudly on the first sealed field — there is no default
and no fallback, by design. And because the bridge only exists at runtime, the
envelope third of the B4 vector cannot be asserted in a Kotlin/Native test; it
is asserted at launch instead, by `zkSelfTest()`, against the same checked-in
constant.

**When to fix** Only if CryptoKit ever becomes reachable from Kotlin/Native, or
if Apple ships GCM in the public CommonCrypto headers. Neither is expected.

## 7. The server allows `|` in a sealed field's key

**Where** `backend/.../e2e/SealedFieldService.kt` — `fieldKey` is checked for
non-blank and a 64-character ceiling, and nothing else.

**What** `|` U+007C separates the four components of the zero-knowledge AAD and
is not escaped, so no component may contain one (docs/zk-interop-acceptance.md
A0, B3). Both clients now enforce that at AAD construction. The server does not,
so a third client — or a direct database write — could still store a key holding
one.

**Is it exploitable today?** No. Of the four components, two are Postgres `uuid`
columns and one is a five-word vocabulary, so none of the three that precede the
free one can hold a pipe; the first three separators always delimit exactly and a
key full of pipes still parses unambiguously. It becomes exploitable the day a
fifth component joins the AAD.

**When to fix** The next backend pass: reject `|` in `fieldKey` alongside the
existing blank and length checks. Additive, and no client sends one.

**Risk if left** None reachable now. The cost is that a rule the clients enforce
is not enforced where the data actually lands.

## 8. The web client can set up zero-knowledge mode but cannot seal a field

**Where** `backend/src/main/resources/static/app/` — `e2e.js` exports
`sealField`, `readSealed` and `unsealField`; no screen calls them.

**What** Settings can enable zero-knowledge mode, unlock it and lock it again.
There is no interface anywhere in the web client for sealing a value on a record
or for reading one back, so the feature is reachable from the browser only
through the module's exported functions.

This matters for how the interop evidence should be read: when the acceptance
run says "the web client sealed it", the shipped `e2e.js` really did the sealing
against the real API — but a person could not have done the same thing by
clicking, because there is no button. The Android app has the screen; the web
does not.

**When to fix** The web-widening pass. The detail sheet is the natural home: a
sealed field belongs beside the record it describes, not on a separate screen —
which is also a hint that the app's current standalone "Sealed" screen is a
staging post rather than the final shape.

**Risk if left** No correctness or data risk. The capability exists and is
proven; it is simply not offered.

---

## 9. A signed-in user with no household has no way out

**Where** `app/shared/src/commonMain/.../App.kt` — the `household == null`
branch of `SignedIn`.

**What** When `households()` comes back empty the app renders one line,
*"No household yet. The web client can create one."*, and nothing else. There is
no sign-out, no back, no retry. The only way off that screen is to delete the
app, because the session is in the Keychain and survives a relaunch straight
back onto the same dead end.

**How it was found** A UI test typed a phone number into an unfocused field, so
ten digits landed somewhere unintended and were sent as a sign-in. Signing in
creates the account when it does not exist — by design — so the run signed in as
a person who had never existed, who therefore belonged to no household, and the
app was stuck. A real person hits exactly this by mistyping their own number by
one digit.

**What it should be** The same escape the lock screen already has. That screen
offers *"Sign in as someone else"* precisely because being unable to get past a
gate must never be terminal, and this screen needs the same line for the same
reason. An invitation hint would help too, but the sign-out is the bug.

**When to fix** The next pass over `App.kt`. It is one `TextButton` calling the
`onSignOut` that is already threaded into `SignedIn`, so there is nothing to
design and nothing to plumb.

**Risk if left** Low severity, high annoyance, and it looks like data loss from
the outside: someone who fat-fingers their number sees an app with none of their
records and no way to try again. Not a privacy or correctness problem — the
empty household is genuinely empty.

**There is one such account in the personal dev stack.** `+919666873377`, made
by the run described above. It is deliberately left in place: it belongs to no
household and holds nothing, so it cannot affect a total or a privacy check, and
hand-deleting a `users` row risks orphaning its sessions and audit entries for
no gain. It is also the live case for reproducing this issue. It should go when
there is a proper account-deletion flow to remove it with — not by row
surgery.
